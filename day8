RECURSION :

Recursion are nothing but Function calling itself and itself till it meets base conditions 
two types = 
Function calling same function itself and itself 

function calling another function itself and itself.
In java we dont have pointers so we cant use reference .
JAVA is strictly pass by value not pass by reference .
If we didnt mention base case properly will get an exception called stack overflow 
Recursions are used to break the code .

Write the code for factrorial using recurion ?

Draw the tree by factorial = 5 * 4 factorial.

after writing Recursion tree :
All the returned values will be pushed into a stack whenever we hit base condition the elements will be popped . 
PSUEDO CODE : 
fact(n){
  if(n==0){
    return i;
  }
  else
    return n * fact(n-1);
