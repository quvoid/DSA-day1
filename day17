if a method is Incomplete we have to add abstract in the method 

if a class contains abstract method we have to mention abstract keyword in front of class .

a abstract class contains abstract methods and non abstract methods 

Interface contains all the abstract methods so we can declare as a class , we have to declare as interface
as we know interface contains only abstract methods.

interface A {
    abstract int method2(int a, int b);  // Interface method declaration
}

class B implements A {
    // Implementing the interface method
    public int method2(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// If you want to create class C, it should implement the interface
class C implements A {
    public int method2(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;  // Different implementation
    }
    
    int method4(int a) {
        return a;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        B obj2 = new B();
        int res = obj2.method2(2, 3);  // Correct method name
        System.out.println(res);  // Output: 5
        
        // If you want to use class C:
        // C obj3 = new C();
        // System.out.println(obj3.method2(2, 3));  // Would output 6
    }
}
