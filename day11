Collection Frameworks : 
LIST                      SET                     MAP

-->ArrayList ------->    HashSet           ------->HashMap
-->LinkedList  ----->    LinkedHashSet     ------->linkedHashMap
-->Vector     ------>    TreeSet           ------->TreeMap


List, SEt ,Map , these are interfaces
rest of the elements are classes

Interface contains incomplete methods 
classes contains complete methods

LIST : 
List contains ordered elements and which can accepts duplicates 
Array List is a dynamic array which can expand its size dynamically by 1.5 times 

Vector is also a dynamic array which can expands its size dynamically by 2 times .

LinkedList : Collection of similar types of elements in random allocation 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SET :
Elements are unordered and we dont accept duplicates 

last set is a class which is used to store as set is unordered , if used treeset , the elements will be ordered .

----------------------------------------------------------------------------=\

MAPs :

Map contains Key : value pairs and TO store key value pairs we use HashMap

Set unmaps are used to get the result  in big O of 1 time complexity 0(1) or constant time complexity
-In sets and maps we dont have index value , just like arrays , we cant use simple for Loop , we have to use for each loop 

---------------------------------------

SYNTAX : 
List<Integer> listname = new ArrayList<>();

Set<Integer> st = new Hashset<>();

Map<Integer,Integer> mp = new HashMap<>();
