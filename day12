MAJORITY ELEMENTS :

input array = [2,2,1,2,1] output = 2 ;
in the given array , if the n is repeated more than 2 times , it is called MAJORITY ELEMENT .

VOTING ALGORITHM :
Assume that the first element is Target element 
we start comparing rest of the elements 
and If we got same elements , increase the counter or else decrease .
Whenever counter become 0 , restart the target value to the next element of array ;
If counter becomes 0 , its states that there is no majority element and if counter is greater than zero , check that target element in our array . 
And count how many times it were repeated and if repeated more than n/2 , THats the majority element 

Longest consecutive elements : 
input[1,2,101,3,103,4,103)

1: Push  the array elements into the sets
2: start iterating set elements Useing for each loop
3: Find the starting point
