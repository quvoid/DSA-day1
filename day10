All the strings are create in string pool
double = operator is used to check the address or reference 

-length() 

-charAt(int index)

-substring(int Beginindex , int endIndex)

-contains(CharSequence s)

-startsWith(String prefix)

-toUpperCase() / toLowerCase()

-trim() - remove leading and trailing spaces

-replace(String old, String new)

-split(String regex)

-equals(String anotherString) / equalsIgnoreCase(String)

SUBSETS : 
For a given array , we get 2^n (power n) subsets .
In a sequence , subset should be in sequence , not in continous .


BACKTRACKING : 
It is an example of recursion , although we are taking same thing taking the value and not taking the value 
we have only two steps , taking the values and not taking the values .
Whenever u reach base case , u have to print all the base case elements .
when array length is equal to original array length , that is our base case .
And in every recursive call , remove the last element then it will backtrack .

DUTCH NATIONAL FLAG ALGORITHM :
{1,0,0,2,1,2,0,2}
Initialise L pointer at 0th index ;
and M pointer at 0th index ; 
and H pointer at n-1 index ;
The elements between M and H are not sorted so we have to run a loop from M to H , 
If both crosses it means we are reaching each and every element 
IF array of M is 0 , swap array of M and array L .
After swapping increase M , increase L 
If array of M = 1 ,Just move M pointer .
If array of m  = 2 ; swap array of M and array of H
after swapping decrease H .
now based on above lIne write the code ?
